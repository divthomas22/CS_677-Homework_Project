## About This Course

CS 677 is a Data Science course that covered the study and practice of statistical analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms, specifically using the Python programming language. 

## Included in this Repository 

This repository contains six weekly homework assignment submissions in which course concepts were practiced using Python code. 

Additionally, a final course project submission is included. The Music Popularity predictor is a machine learning program that takes in a dataset containing a multitude songs in Spotify charts, both popular and unpopular, along with their technical traits, to determine the best model to predict music popularity. This project demonstrates knowledge gained from the coursework and assignments submissions regarding the concepts of machine learning and data science.
